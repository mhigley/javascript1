# JavaScript1 Geekwise Academy Documentation
All embedded CSS from each page stripped out and put into an external CSS file. 17k lines of repetitious CSS beautified: [Code Beautifier](http://www.codebeautifier.com/) and linted: [CSS Lint](http://csslint.net/) into a nice maintainable 303 lines.  

Every HTML page has been beautified via the Atom package: [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)  
Due to this process, all Ace Code Blocks have been misaligned. Easiest fix is to copy the selected HTML and run through the minifier found here: [HTML Minifier](http://www.willpeavy.com/minifier/)  

Long term goals:
* Create a more dynamic navigation system
* Convert to Jekyll framework (?)
* Improve UX/UI
* CSS Redesign
