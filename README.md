All embedded CSS from each page stripped out and put into an external CSS file.  

Every HTML page has been beautified via the Atom package: [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)  
Due to this process, all Ace Code Blocks have been misaligned. Easiest fix is to copy the selected HTML and run through the minifier found here: [HTML Minifier](http://www.willpeavy.com/minifier/)
